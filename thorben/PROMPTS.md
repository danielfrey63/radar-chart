# Conversation Prompts and Analysis Flow

## Initial Request
> I want to reverse engineer this software and create a markdown with its features, descriptions and acceptance criteria for each feature. How do we do this?

**Result**: Created FEATURES_SPEC.md with comprehensive breakdown of features and acceptance criteria.

## Feature Breakdown Request
> Lets keep theses main features as epics and create smaller stories with a user functionality. Each story should have at least one acceptance criteria

**Result**: Created USER_STORIES.md breaking down epics into detailed user stories with acceptance criteria.

## Feature Count Analysis
> wie viele feature hat die anwendung?

**Result**: Analysis showed:
- 7 Epics (main features)
- 31 User Stories (detailed features)
- Focus on first three epics (15 of 31 features)

## Dependencies Analysis
> gibt es abh'ngigkeiten ywischen den features?

**Result**: Created DEPENDENCIES.md showing:
- Core dependencies
- Feature-specific dependencies
- Recommended implementation order in 5 phases

## Visualization Request
> bitte erstelle ein mermaid diagram f[r diese abhaengigkeiten

**Result**: Created DEPENDENCIES_DIAGRAM.md with:
- Mermaid diagram showing all dependencies
- Color-coded implementation phases
- Clear visualization of feature relationships

## Analysis Flow
1. Initial feature extraction and documentation
2. Breaking down features into user stories
3. Quantitative analysis of features
4. Dependency analysis
5. Visual representation of dependencies

## Created Documents
1. FEATURES_SPEC.md - Main feature specifications
2. USER_STORIES.md - Detailed user stories
3. DEPENDENCIES.md - Feature dependencies
4. DEPENDENCIES_DIAGRAM.md - Visual dependency map

## Key Findings
- The application has a clear hierarchical structure
- Features are well-distributed across different aspects of functionality
- Clear dependencies exist between core and advanced features
- Implementation can be organized into 5 distinct phases
- Core features (View Data Hierarchy, CSV Upload, Data Persistence) form the foundation
